	<p id = "description">Ramen came to Japan from China, 
	but nobody really knows exactly when. It is speculated 
	that the word ramen comes from the Chinese lamian, 
	which means hand-pulled noodles. Indeed, even today the 
	word ramen is usually written in Katakana, the alphabet 
	used in Japanese for foreign loanwords, indicating that 
	they are not of Japanese origin. <br/><br/>Although various forms 
	of ramen had existed before, it was after the second 
	world war, when many Japanese returned home after being 
	stationed in China, that ramen really took off. Not only 
	were these men now familiar with the ingredients used in 
	Chinese cuisine, but cheap flour was being imported from 
	the US, which made it easier than ever to make noodles. 
	<br/><br/>Ramen bars exploded in popularity all over the country, 
	but it was still a time when people went out to eat ramen 
	rather than eating them at home.
